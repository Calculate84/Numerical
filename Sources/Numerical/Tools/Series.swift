///    - indices: Any sequence of integers. Can be an infinite sequence (e.g. 1...)

///    - tolerance: Allowable tolerance for deciding the series has converged and truncating. Default is fairly strict
///    - update: Closure defining the ith term of the sequence. Has access to the index, i, and any state as of the previous term
///
/// - Returns: A `SeriesResult` that encodes whether the series converged or not and how many terms were calculated
